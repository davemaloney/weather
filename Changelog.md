A brand new weather forecasting app! Hooray!

The two most important files to get how things are put together are [app/containers/ForecastContainer/index.js](app/containers/ForecastContainer/index.js) [app/containers/ForecastContainer/saga.js](app/containers/ForecastContainer/saga.js). The ForecastContainer `index.js` contains all the form and submission handlers, and `sagas.js` handles all the interaction with the API.
